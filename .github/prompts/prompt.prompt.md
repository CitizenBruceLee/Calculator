Design state of the art calculator that uses smilies instead of numbers and operations. The calculator should:
- Support basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Provide a clear, user-friendly CLI interface with prompts and error handling
- Be modular, well-documented, and easy to extend for new features or operations
- Include helpful messages and visual (text-based) feedback for user actions
